# Plant-Disease-Detection
Plant Disease Detection is an AI-powered system that identifies plant leaf diseases from images using machine learning.
It processes leaf images to detect and classify diseases with high accuracy, helping farmers take timely action.
The model is trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased leaves for various crops.
This project promotes smart agriculture by preventing crop loss through early disease detection.
